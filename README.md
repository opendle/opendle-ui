# OpenDLE UI

OpenDLE UI is the shared React framework and design system for the
[llmrouter](https://github.com/tubededentifrice/llmrouter),
[ontology](https://github.com/tubededentifrice/ontology), and
[xbot](https://github.com/tubededentifrice/xbot) projects.

## Scope

This repository owns shared design tokens, accessible React primitives,
composition patterns, and frontend quality tools. Host applications own
product behavior, routing, data access, and service integration.

The package starts as `@opendle/ui`. Add a shared primitive here when at least
two host projects need the same behavior. Keep the public API small and test
the user-visible behavior.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
./scripts/check-repository.sh
```
